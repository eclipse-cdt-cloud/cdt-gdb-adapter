# To make sure we don't give unnecessary permissions to the workflow that runs when PRs
# are built, we split the build and report back of test results into two workflows.
# This is based on documention of https://github.com/marketplace/actions/junit-report-action
# with the slight complication that we need to collect both Windows and Ubuntu results
# and combine them together.
