/**
 * Open and read a file from a subprocess (mode `r+` only).
 *
 * This is useful when opening a ptmx/pts pair at the same time.
 * When both files are opened by the same process, closing does not correctly release
 * the read callbacks, leaving node hanging at exit.
 *
 * Instead, we open one of the two files in a subprocess in order to kill it once done,
 * which will properly release read callbacks for some reason.
